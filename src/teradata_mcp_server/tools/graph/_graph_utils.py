"""
_graph_utils.py — Shared utility functions for graph analysis tools.

This module is INTERNAL to the graph tool package — it is not registered
as an MCP tool and is not imported by the server directly. It exists to
avoid duplicating the BFS helper logic across individual tool files.

Naming convention: the leading underscore signals internal use only.

Contents:
  bfs_safe_int            — Safe int conversion for nullable level columns
  create_bfs_summary      — Summary statistics from a BFS node result list
  extract_cycle_candidates — Extract direction='BOTH' nodes as cycle candidates

These helpers were originally private functions (_bfs_safe_int,
_create_bfs_summary, _extract_cycle_candidates) embedded in the monolithic
graph_tools.py. They are lifted here unchanged so each tool file can import
them rather than carrying local copies.

def parse_csv_patterns(csv_str: str) -> list[str]:

    Split a CSV pattern string into a list of trimmed, non-empty tokens.

    Used by all graph tools to normalise container_pattern, exclude_objects,
    include_containers, root_node_list, and similar CSV inputs before use.

    Arguments:
      csv_str - Comma-separated string (may contain whitespace around commas,
                or be empty / None)

    Returns:
      List of trimmed non-empty strings; empty list if csv_str is blank or None

def build_like_or(patterns: list[str], column: str) -> str:
    """
    Build a parenthesised OR-joined LIKE clause for a SQL WHERE predicate.

    Used by graph tools to construct container-scoping predicates against a
    single SQL column (typically Src_Container_Name or Tgt_Container_Name).

    Arguments:
      patterns - List of SQL LIKE pattern strings (e.g. ['%SALES%', '%FIN%'])
      column   - SQL column reference (e.g. 'Src_Container_Name')

    Returns:
      SQL fragment of the form "(col LIKE 'A%' OR col LIKE 'B%')".
      Callers must ensure patterns is non-empty before calling — an empty
      list produces the degenerate string "()" which is invalid SQL.

    Create summary statistics from a BFS node result list.

    cycle_candidates is passed in from the caller rather than being
    computed internally — extract_cycle_candidates is called once in
    the handler and the result is shared here and in response_data,
    avoiding a redundant second pass over the node list.

    Extract nodes that are reachable in both directions with unequal
    absolute upstream and downstream levels.

    A node with direction='BOTH' and abs(upstream_level) != downstream_level
    is a cycle candidate — the asymmetry indicates a back-edge in the graph,
    which is the hallmark of a circular reference when traversing the
    object dependency graph.

    Nodes with direction='BOTH' and equal absolute levels are shared
    dependencies (reachable in both directions at the same hop count)
    and are included with cycle_likely=False for completeness.
