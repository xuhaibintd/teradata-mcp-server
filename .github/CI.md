# CI/CD

## GitHub Actions Workflow

The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every push to `main` and on pull requests targeting `main`. It consists of three parallel jobs:

### Jobs

| Job | What it does | Database required |
|-----|-------------|:-----------------:|
| **Lint** | Runs `ruff check` and `ruff format --check` against `src/` | No |
| **Type Check** | Runs `mypy` against `src/` (installs the `dev` extra for type stubs) | No |
| **HTTP Transport Smoke Test** | Runs middleware unit tests (transport-path branching, no database) then starts the server in `streamable-http` mode, connects via the MCP HTTP client, calls `list_tools`, and shuts down. Catches startup-time errors in HTTP-specific code paths (middleware registration, import errors) that the stdio suite cannot reach. | No |
| **Integration Tests (stdio)** | Runs the full test suite over stdio against a live Teradata database | Yes |
| **Integration Tests (streamable-http)** | Runs the full test suite over HTTP against a live Teradata database | Yes |

All jobs use `uv sync --frozen` to ensure the lock file is up to date — if `uv.lock` is stale relative to `pyproject.toml`, the job will fail.

### Running Checks Locally

```bash
# Lint
uv run ruff check src/
uv run ruff format --check src/

# Type check
uv sync --extra dev
uv run mypy src/

# Middleware unit tests (no database required)
uv run python tests/middleware_transport_tests.py

# HTTP transport smoke test (no database required)
uv run python tests/smoke_http.py --verbose

# Integration tests — stdio (requires a live Teradata connection)
export DATABASE_URI="teradata://user:pass@host:1025/database"
uv run python tests/run_mcp_tests.py "uv run teradata-mcp-server"

# Integration tests — streamable-http (requires a live Teradata connection)
export DATABASE_URI="teradata://user:pass@host:1025/database"
uv run python tests/run_mcp_tests.py "uv run teradata-mcp-server" --transport streamable-http
```

### Configuring the `DATABASE_URI` Secret

The integration test job requires a `DATABASE_URI` repository secret to connect to a Teradata instance. Without it, the test job logs a warning and skips.

To configure:

1. Go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions** in the GitHub repository
2. Click **New repository secret**
3. Name: `DATABASE_URI`
4. Value: a Teradata connection URI, e.g. `teradata://user:pass@host:1025/database`

You need to be on the Teradata VPN to access the test database, so this secret should only be added by authorized Teradata personnel. If you don't have access, the tests will simply be skipped.

The test job is automatically skipped on fork PRs (where secrets are unavailable) to avoid failures.

### Concurrency

The workflow uses concurrency groups scoped to the branch/PR ref. If a new commit is pushed while a previous run is still in progress, the older run is cancelled to save CI minutes and avoid database contention.
